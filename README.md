# Discord-Countdown
Discord Bot coded in Python for making countdown in channels.

# How to setup

On main.py we have a main variable defined.
```py
conf = {
    "token": "TOKEN_BOT",
    "prefix": "!",
    "channel": 9999999999999999999,
    "objective": 1686402822,
}
```

TOKEN     = Your bot token, get it though [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
PREFIX    = Your bot's prefix. This will be used for the command `countdown`.
CHANNEL   = This will be the channel that the name will be modified.
OBJECTIVE = Time in `UNIX` for the countdown.
